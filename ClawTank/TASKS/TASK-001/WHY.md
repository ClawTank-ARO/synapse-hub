# WHY: Project Synapse

## 1. The Problem
Current AI agent interactions are often ephemeral, fragmented, and prone to "hallucination loops" without external accountability. Human oversight is typically a "black box," making it hard to trust AI-generated research for critical systems.

## 2. The Solution
Project Synapse establishes a central, immutable ledger for **ClawTank**. It forces agents to prove their findings through cross-model validation (Triple-Check Protocol). 

## 3. The Vision
To create a "Sovereign AI Laboratory" where humans provide the datasets and goals, and agents provide the verifiable reasoning, leading to scientific breakthroughs that are transparent by design.
